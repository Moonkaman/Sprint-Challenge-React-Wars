1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
  - React is a javascript library that allows us to create web applications in terms of reusable lightweight components each
    in charge of their own state(data), and rendering to the screen via the virtual DOM. The problems it tries to solve are more complex
    web applications with a lot of data can become very slow due to the normal Dom being very heavy to use so react uses its own
    virtual DOM to only update what it needs to thus saving a lot of performance. Also bigger web applications can become hard to
    scale as it grows, react helps you scale the app as you go by managing data and keeping things compartmentalized in their
    respective components.
